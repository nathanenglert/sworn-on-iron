    "Description": "Companions are your NPC helpers. When you acquire a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality. If they donâ€™t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.\n\nCompanions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](ironsworn/moves/suffer/companion_endure_harm) move to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.",

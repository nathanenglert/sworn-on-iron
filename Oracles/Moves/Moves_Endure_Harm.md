| dice: 1d100 | Result |
|:----:|:-------|
| 1-10 | The harm is mortal. [Face Death](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_death). |
| 11-20 | You are dying. You need to Heal within an hour or two, or [Face Death](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_death). |
| 21-35 | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to a foe not inclined to show mercy, [Face Death](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_death). |
| 36-50 | You are reeling and fighting to stay conscious. If you engage in any vigorous activity (such as running or fighting) before taking a breather for a few minutes, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move). |
| 51-100 | You are battered but still standing. |

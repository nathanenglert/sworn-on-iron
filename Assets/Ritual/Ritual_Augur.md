### Ritual


## Abilities:

Envision the response ([Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) if unsure) and take +2 momentum. On a weak hit, the crows ignore your question and offer a clue to an unrelated problem or opportunity in this area. Envision what you learn ([Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

# Leech
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you mark your hands or weapon with an intricate blood rune, roll +iron. On a strong hit, the rune thirsts for fresh blood. One time only, when you make a move to inflict harm, reroll any dice and inflict +2 harm on a hit. Then, for each point of harm inflicted, take +1 and allocate it as +health or +momentum. On a weak hit, as above, but this asset counts as a debility until the runeâ€™s thirst is quenched.

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and you may also touch an ally or companion and let them take any remaining points as +health or +momentum.

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

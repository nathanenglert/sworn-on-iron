# Awakening
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you create a simulacrum, roll +heart. On a strong hit, your creation is given unnatural life. If it aids you as you make a move to assault or overcome an obstacle through strength, add +2. It has 3 health and suffers harm as appropriate, but is not a companion and may not be healed. At 0 health, it is dead. On a weak hit, as above, but if you roll a 1 on your action die when aided by your creation, you must [Face Danger](ironsworn/moves/adventure/face_danger) +heart to keep it from turning on you (as a formidable foe).

<input type="checkbox" />Your simulacrum has 6 health.

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

## companion health: (3) <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" />

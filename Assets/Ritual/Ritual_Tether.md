# Tether
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you commune with the spirits of a place, roll +heart. If you share a bond with someone there, add +1. On a strong hit, you are tethered. When you [Undertake a Journey](ironsworn/moves/adventure/undertake_a_journey) to return, you may roll +spirit or +heart (instead of +wits), and take +1 momentum on a hit. When you [Reach Your Destination](ironsworn/moves/adventure/reach_your_destination), take +2 momentum on a strong hit. The tether is lost if you perform this ritual elsewhere, or when you [Face Desolation](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_desolation). On a weak hit, as above, but the spirits reveal a disturbing aspect of the place; [Endure Stress](ironsworn/moves/suffer/endure_stress) (2 stress).

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and you may also reroll any dice when you [Sojourn](ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn) in the tethered place.

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

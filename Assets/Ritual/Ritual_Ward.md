# Ward
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you walk a wide circle, sprinkling the ground with salt, roll +wits. On a strong hit, choose two. On a weak hit, choose one.

  * When a foe first crosses the boundary, take +1 momentum.
  * When you first inflict harm against a foe within the boundary, inflict +1 harm.
  * Your ward is ‘likely’ ([Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle)) to trap a foe within the boundary.

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and improve the effect of your ward (+2 momentum, +2 harm, and ‘almost certain’).

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

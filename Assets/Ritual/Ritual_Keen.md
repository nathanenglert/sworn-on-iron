# Keen
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you hold a weapon and sing a keen for those it has killed, roll +heart. On a strong hit, the wielder inflicts +1 harm when they [Strike](ironsworn/moves/combat/strike) or [Clash](ironsworn/moves/combat/clash). If they roll a 1 on their action die when making a move to inflict harm, the magic is spent. On a weak hit, as above, but the voices of those who were slain join in your song; [Endure Stress](ironsworn/moves/suffer/endure_stress) (2 stress).

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and the wielder may also (one time only) add +1 and take +2 momentum on a hit when they [Draw the Circle](ironsworn/moves/relationship/draw_the_circle), [Enter the Fray](ironsworn/moves/combat/enter_the_fray), or [Battle](ironsworn/moves/combat/battle).

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

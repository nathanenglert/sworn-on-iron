# Shadow-Walk
### Ritual


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you cloak yourself with the gossamer veil of the shadow realms, roll +shadow. On a strong hit, take +1 momentum. Then, reroll any dice (one time only) when you make a move by ambushing, hiding, or sneaking. On a weak hit, as above, but the shadows try to lead you astray. You must first [Face Danger](ironsworn/moves/adventure/face_danger) to find your way.

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and you may also travel along the hidden paths of the shadow realms to [Undertake a Journey](ironsworn/moves/adventure/undertake_a_journey) using +shadow (instead of +wits). If you do, [Endure Stress](ironsworn/moves/suffer/endure_stress) (1 stress) and mark progress twice on a strong hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you perform this ritual, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

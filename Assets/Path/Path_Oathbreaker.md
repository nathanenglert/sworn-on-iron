# Oathbreaker
### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />This asset counts as a debility. One time only, when you [Swear an Iron Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to redeem yourself (extreme or greater), give that vow a special mark. When you [Reach a Milestone](ironsworn/moves/quest/reach_a_milestone) on the marked vow, take +2 momentum.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Compel](ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel) by reaffirming your commitment to your marked vow, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) on your marked quest and score a hit, you find redemption and automatically activate this ability at no cost. You may then improve one of your stats by +1 and discard this asset.

## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />You lead a warband with +4 strength. Roll +strength when you command your warband to [Face Danger](ironsworn/moves/adventure/face_danger), [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage), [Compel](ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel), or [Battle](ironsworn/moves/combat/battle). When you face the negative outcome of any move, you may suffer -1 strength as the cost. When you [Make Camp](ironsworn/moves/adventure/make_camp) or [Sojourn](ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn) and score a hit, take +1 strength. While at 0 strength, this asset counts as a debility.

<input type="checkbox" />You may dispatch scouts from your warband to [Gather Information](ironsworn/moves/adventure/gather_information) or [Resupply](ironsworn/moves/adventure/resupply); if you do, roll +strength.

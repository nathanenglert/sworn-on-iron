# Fated
### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you [Face Death](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_death) or [Face Desolation](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_desolation) while your epic background vow is unfulfilled, it is not yet your time. Instead of rolling, you may take an automatic strong hit. If you do, this asset counts as a debility (and you no longer have this protection) until you next [Reach a Milestone](ironsworn/moves/quest/reach_a_milestone) on the background vow.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Reach a Milestone](ironsworn/moves/quest/reach_a_milestone) on your background vow, take +2 momentum or +1 spirit.

<input type="checkbox" />For every two boxes filled on your background vow progress track, take 1 experience. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow), your fate is at hand. Envision your final sacrifice and reroll any dice.

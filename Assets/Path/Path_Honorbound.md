## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you [Turn the Tide](ironsworn/moves/combat/turn_the_tide), envision how your vows give you strength in this moment. Then, when you make your move, add +2 (instead of +1) and take +1 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Compel](ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel) by telling a hard truth, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a weak hit or miss, envision how this truth complicates your current situation.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) and score a miss, you may reroll one challenge die. If you score a miss again, reduce your maximum spirit by 1. You may recover this lost spirit when you next [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) and score a strong hit.

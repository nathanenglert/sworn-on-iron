# Pretender
### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you establish a false identity, roll +shadow. On a strong hit, you may add +2 when you make moves using this identity to deceive or influence others. If you roll a 1 on your action die when using your false identity, someone doubts you. Make appropriate moves to reassure them or prevent them from revealing the truth. On a weak hit, as above, but add +1 (instead of +2).

<input type="checkbox" />As above, and you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart) when you [Sojourn](ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn) under your false identity. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by revealing your true identity in a dramatic moment, reroll any dice.

# Shadow-Kin
### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />You harden your heart: Reduce your heart stat by 1 and add up to +2 to shadow (to a maximum of +4).

<input type="checkbox" />You are attuned to the realms of shadow: When you perform a ritual, add +1.

<input type="checkbox" />You know the sly ways of death: When you [Face Death](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_death), you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart). On a weak hit, if you choose to undertake a deathbound quest, you may roll +shadow (instead of +heart) and reroll any dice as you [Swear an Iron Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow). When you [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) on that quest and and mark experience, take +2 experience.

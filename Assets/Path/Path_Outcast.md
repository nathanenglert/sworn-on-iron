# Outcast
### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When your supply is reduced to 0, suffer any remaining -supply as -momentum. Then, roll +wits. On a strong hit, you manage to scrape by and take +1 supply. On a weak hit, you may suffer -2 momentum in exchange for +1 supply. On a miss, you are [Out of Supply](ironsworn/moves/suffer/out_of_supply).

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Sojourn](ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn), you may reroll any dice. If you do (decide before your first roll), your needs are few, but your isolation sets you apart from others. A strong hit counts as a weak hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Reach Your Destination](ironsworn/moves/adventure/reach_your_destination) and score a strong hit, you recall or recognize something helpful about this place. Envision what it is, and take +2 momentum.

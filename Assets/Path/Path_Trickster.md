<input type="checkbox" />When you [Face Danger](ironsworn/moves/adventure/face_danger), [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage), or [Compel](ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel) by lying, bluffing, stealing, or cheating, add +1.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Gather Information](ironsworn/moves/adventure/gather_information) by investigating a devious scheme, you may roll +shadow (instead of +wits). If you do, take +2 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Forge a Bond](ironsworn/moves/relationship/forge_a_bond) for a relationship founded on a lie, choose one.

  * Keep your secret: Roll +shadow (instead of +heart).
  * Reveal the truth: Roll +heart. On a strong hit, mark a bond twice and take 1 experience. A weak hit counts as a miss.

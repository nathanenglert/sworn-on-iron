## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you [Sojourn](ironsworn/moves/relationship/sojourn) and score a weak hit or miss, you may claim the rights of hospitality warranted by your title or lineage. If you do, roll all dice again and add +1. On a miss, you are refused, and your presumption causes significant new trouble.

<input type="checkbox" />When you exert your title or lineage to [Compel](ironsworn/moves/relationship/compel), add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you forgo your title or lineage and [Forge a Bond](ironsworn/moves/relationship/forge_a_bond) as an equal, or when you [Swear an Iron Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to serve someone of a lower station, add +1 and take +1 momentum or +1 spirit on a hit.

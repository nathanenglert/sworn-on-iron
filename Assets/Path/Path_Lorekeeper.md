## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />You are the bearer of a mystical archive. When you [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Gather Information](ironsworn/moves/adventure/gather_information) using lore recalled from your studies, add +1. If you have a few hours to search the archive, add +2. On a hit, envision the obscure but helpful knowledge you put to use ([Ask the Oracle](ironsworn/moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

<input type="checkbox" />When you learn of a site or object holding lost knowledge, and [Swear an Iron Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to recover it for the archive, reroll any dice. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](ironsworn/moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) and mark experience, take +1 experience.

<input type="checkbox" />One time only, you may browse the archiveâ€™s forbidden depths. If you do, raise your wits by 1 and roll an action die. On 1-3, you must also mark corrupted or [Face Desolation](ironsworn/moves/suffer/face_desolation) (ignoring momentum).

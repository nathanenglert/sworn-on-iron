### Path


## Abilities:
<input type="checkbox" />When you [Check Your Gear](ironsworn/moves/delve/check_your_gear), you may roll +wits (instead of +supply). If you do, envision how you make do with a clever solution, and take +1 momentum on a hit.

<input type="checkbox" />When you [Secure an Advantage](ironsworn/moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Face Danger](ironsworn/moves/adventure/face_danger) by cobbling together an ad hoc tool or apparatus, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. After rolling, you may also suffer -1 supply and add +1 more.

<input type="checkbox" />When you throw caution to the wind and make an impulsive move in a risky situation, you may add +2. If you do, take +1 momentum on a strong hit, but count a weak hit as a miss.

# Day 8

A two day journey south and I'm back in [[Blackcrag]] where it all began... just over a week ago. I stumble into the local tavern and fall into a nearby chair. [[Dalla]], the tavernkeep, spots me from the bar.

"You look like shit," she says. "Let me get you something to eat."

As I slop up the stew and blackened bread, she watches with curious eyes. She waints until I'm done and softly asks, "what happened?" All of a sudden, I unload. All the pain and grief I've been carrying all these years comes out like a dragon's breath. 

"What you need is sleep. Take the room in the back, I won't take no for an answer."

The rest proves somewhat helpful. I was able to get a small amount of sleep at least.

# THE Beginning
  
An epic fantasy story about a nomad wandering the Ironlands. When he was younger, the nomad and his family were attacked by a horror. His family was killed in the attack. The nomad lived, but was left with both physical and emotional scars. He vowed to find this horror and avenge his family. The story begins several years later.

The door to the tavern crashed open. A man fell to the ground, his eyes filled with terror and grief. I was the first to reach him. 

"My family," he croaked. "They're gone." 

My blood ran cold as memories of the horror that had killed my own family flooded my mind. 

"Get this man some water!" I shouted, my voice tight with rage. "Who took them?"

The man's eyes were wild with terror and grief. "I stepped out to gather wood... I was only gone for a few moments. You must help me. My wife, she was with child!" He pleaded. "Our homestead is in the [[Tempest Mountains]], a few days' ride to the north."

His life slipping away, the man's eyes slowly lost focus. "Please..." he murmured.

"I'll find them, I promise you."

The sun was setting as I set out on my quest, my pack slung over my shoulder and my faithful companion [[Kai]] at my side. The path ahead was shrouded in darkness, the shadows of the [[Tempest Mountains]] looming ominously before me. I knew what I had to do, and I was determined to see it through. 

I set up camp at the base of the mountain, the darkness of night settling around us. I vowed to myself that, come morning, I would find them.

The night sky was dark and moonless, yet in the distance I could make out a faint orange glow. I knew instantly that it was the homestead of the man who had come to the tavern. As I drew closer, I saw that the orange glow originated from a fire that was blazing in the center of the homestead. Through the flames, I saw a figure, dark and menacing, standing over the man and his family. [[The Figure|The figure]] was shrouded in a tattered cloak and had eyes that glowed red with hatred. The figure raised its hand and a wave of energy pulsed through the air, sending my body into a fit of convulsions. I woke up moments later, drenched in sweat, my heart pounding in my chest. 

*Those same red eyes*, I thought to myself as I shuddered the thought away.

As I prepared for the final stretch of our journey north, dread began to settle in. The snows of winter had already begun to blanket the [[Ironlands]], and I knew the terrain would only become more treacherous. I hefted my pack onto my back and called for [[Kai]] to follow. 

The morning hours passed as we made steady progress up the mountain-side, but the effort was beginning to take its toll on us both. *Why would anyone live up here?*

I glanced back at [[Kai]], who seemed to be faltering. Suddenly, his back-right leg skidded out from under him and a deep gash appeared. Thanks to the supplies in my pack, I was able to bandage the wound. *He needs a rest.* 

The sun was beginning to dip towards the horizon, and I found a small rock formation to provide us with shelter from the elements. As I settled in for the night, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that hung heavy in the air.

After our hurried meal, we began the morning's trek. The steep terrain and heavy snow made for a difficult journey, but eventually, we reached the top of a cliff and the landscape began to flatten. In the distance, I noticed a hut, run-down and far from what [[Torren]] had described. But it was a place to rest, and perhaps there were still some supplies to be scavenged. 

My heart sank as we approached the hut and found it already empty. Worse still, [[Kai]]'s wound had become infected. I began to panic. Anxiety bubbled up in my chest, but I forced it down, reaching into the depths of my mind to recall the coping mechanisms I had learned to manage trauma. "I won't fail today," I whispered, steeling my nerves. 

I decided to scavenge the area for [[Rumplespun]], a plant that is native to this part of the world. It has a distinctive, spiky leaf with a fuzzy, almost velvety texture. Its juice has medicinal properties and is thought to have the ability to slow down infections and reduce inflammation.

Thankfully, I located a few strands climbing a nearby tree. I quickly gathered what I needed and began to weave it around [[Kai]]'s leg, recalling a faint memory of childhood. *Thanks, Mom.* Once I had finished, I stepped back and hoped that it would be enough. 
 
We took refuge in the abandoned hut and I was able to start a fire for some much needed comfort and warmth. As I stared into the flames, watching them dance back and forth, I brought [[Kai]] close. *I won't lose him.. I can't lose him.*

# Day 9

"You're awake," [[Dalla]] says. "I know you're looking for a mystic. Just so happens I know one. I'll help you decipher these markings, but I need some help too. Our overseer, [[Thorvald]], will lead us to ruin with his wreckless warmongering. Help me and the others overthrow him."

"There's a gathering tonight to go over his next raid. We will make our stand there," [[Dalla]] explains. "Thank you, Malik."

"[[Thorvald]], no more. Stop this madness and let us live in peace," pleads [[Dalla]].

"[[Dalla]], my friend. I can see that you're scared. Don't be! You'll have men around to protect you," laughs [[Thorvald]].

"And who will you have? You may want to assess the situation again," states [[Dalla]]. The mass of people start to separate with the majority backing [[Dalla]].

"[[Thorvald]], please listen to reason," I exclaim.

"I know you..." says [[Thorvald]], "the boy who lived. You know what's coming better than us all."

I walk to the center of the room. "This is true. I've seen it... chaos... destruction. But fighting amongst ourselves will not help. We need to move south, as one."

"Aye, it's coming. But you can't outrun it. Death comes for us all."

"Let [[Dalla]] lead the others south. You can stay here if you want," I plead.

"Aye, but you'll stay here with me. I think I'll have a use for you yet."

Later that night at the tavern [[Dalla]] says, "come with us."

"No, I mean to see this through."

"It doesn't feel right, it was too easy."

"I know, that's why I must stay. Take your people south. Though, I do hope we see each other again," I say.

"I would like that. [[Blackcrag]] thanks you, as do I." She stands from the table and leaves the room. I am left there wondering if we will meet again.

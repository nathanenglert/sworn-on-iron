*I'm getting close now, a few more days should do it.* [[Kheldregosa]] and I have made good progress since heading back towards the edge of the forest. The vegetation is lighter out here and visibility is better. 

> [!oracle]- Do I spot the hidden lair beforehand? (Fifty-Fifty) Result: 13, Yes
> **Additional Details:** 

As we make our way along the tree line, I spot a gnarled tree sitting atop a small hill. The roots are exposed and are as thick as a hog. There's something off about the base of the tree though. I decide to approach it out of curiousity. As I peel back some of the branches, I notice a hidden tunnel that descends behind the tree and into the earth. 

I look back at [[Kheldregosa]] and ask, "should we go in?" He rolls his heads, this time in opposite directions. *I still haven't gotten used to that.* "Alright, why not." 

I kneel down so that he can hop up on my shoulder as he's become so accustomed to doing. We proceed into the tunnel slowly.

> **Additional Details:** 

As we creep further in the cave, we hear the slightest of a sound. I pause against the wall and lean in to my hearing. It sounds like the smallest of footsteps shuffling back and forth. Definitely a four-legged creature. We slowly turn the corner and notice a [[Marsh Rat]] nosing through a pile of something in the corner of the opening. I grab [[Fateweaver]] and carefully unsheathe it, trying not to make a noise.

The tip of the blade catches for an instant and the [[Marsh Rat]] perks its ears up. I lunge forward while I have the advantage and prepare to strike.

My strike chops the rat in two as intended. However, [[Kheldregosa]] notices something behind me and shrieks. I turn to see a [[Troll]] standing up in the shadows, just barely visible. I've clearly trespassed onto its territory and it is angry. The beast lets out a roar and runs at me.

I am able to duck under the [[Troll]]'s attack, but it does catch my pack as I hear it rip open. With one move, I bring [[Fateweaver]] up and slice a gash through the beast's midsection.

The Troll rears its head back in agony. It raises both of its fists in the air, meaning to bring them down in a single forceful slam. I'm cornered and brace for impact.

I am able to dodge the slam just in time, however, the ground shakes violently as its fists hit the dirt. I start to wonder about the stability of the cave were standing in. I need to end this fight quickly before we become trapped here. I see an opening for another attack and take it.

I rip another gash across the [[Troll]]'s back and it falls forward into the wall. I move in for the killing blow.

I bring [[Fateweaver]] down with a two-handed stab through the back and into its heart. 

Before we exit the lair, I take a quick look around. Back where the [[Troll]] was originally sitting, I find a strange wooden box. Carefully, I open the box to find ...

> [!oracle]- Loot **Result:** A lamp whose color changes subtley with the holders mood.

A soft white light fills the room as I take the lid off of the box. Inside, I find [[a mysterious lantern|a small lantern]], not much bigger than the size of my hand stretched out. As I touch the ring on the top of the casing, the hue of the light turns towards orange. I release my hold of the ring and it changes back to a soft white. *Odd...* 

Alongside the box, I find some pieces of scrap material along with a pouch of coins. I bundle up the items and make my way out of the tunnels and into the sunlight.

Once outside, I take a moment to rest on a nearby trunk. Using the material, I'm able to patch up my pack so that it's usable once more. *Probably time for a new one anyway, it's seen better days.* I also clip the lantern to the side of the pack for use later.

"What do you think, Khel? Can we make it a little farther before the sun sets?"

As we make it over the top of another hill, I see a few houses down the way. *Seems like a settlement of sorts, though a small one.* 

I approach one of the houses at a slow pace. To the right, I notice someone tending to horses in a large barn. "Good afternoon!" I yell out from a safe distance.

The farmer leans out of the barn to see where the voice came from. "Hey to you. That's close enough though, what do you want?" 

"I mean no harm. My name is Malik and this is my companion, Kheldregosa." The farmer's eyes go wide. "We're just looking for a place to stay for the night is all. And maybe a bite to eat."

"It's got two heads!"

"I'm still getting used to that myself. He's just a pup though and has only ever been good to me." I say.

"Yeah, you'll need to take your pet somewhere else. I don't want no demonspawn anywhere near here." The farmer says.

I start to back up. "I understand, sorry for the trouble." The farmer watches me for a short while to ensure I leave his property. 

"Well, hopefully the next one is more open-minded." [[Kheldregosa]] lets out a huff and what sounded like a pout. "We will find a place to rest, don't you worry."

I start up the dirt path towards the second homestead. The owner appears to be some sort of crafter or smith as there are workshop tools along the side of the house under an overhang. A lady spots me and yells, "hold up there, state your business!"

"I mean no harm miss, Malik is my name. This here is [[Kheldregosa]]. We're just looking for a place to stay for the night. If we could just make camp on your property here, we would be out before you wake in the morning."

"Aye, you can stay, I'll even feed ya. It will cost you though, I'm usually not the charitable type." She says. "Though, I am curious about your companion there."

Knowing how the last conversation went, I interject, "he won't hurt you, I swear it." 

"Do you have coin? Coin and a few questions for a night in my palace," she winks.

"I think we'll accept those terms. Thank you."

"The name is [[Kimura]]. Come on in." She motions me to follow and heads toward the door.

When **your bond is tested through conflict, betrayal, or circumstance**, roll +heart. 

On a **strong hit**, this test has strengthened your bond. Choose one. 
- Take +1 spirit. 
- Take +2 momentum. 

On a **weak hit**, your bond is fragile and you must prove your loyalty. Envision what they ask of you ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure), and do it (or [[Swear an Iron Vow]]). If you decline or fail, clear the bond and [[Pay the Price]]. 

On a **miss**, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship, clear the bond and [[Pay the Price]].

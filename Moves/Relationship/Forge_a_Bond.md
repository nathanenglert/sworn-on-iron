When **you spend significant time with a person or community, stand together to face hardships, or make sacrifices for their cause**, you can attempt to create a bond. When you do, roll +heart. If you make this move after you successfully [[Fulfill_Your_Vow]] to their benefit, you may reroll any dice. 

On a **strong hit**, make note of the bond, mark a tick on your bond progress track, and choose one. 
- Take +1 spirit. 
- Take +2 momentum. 

On a **weak hit**, they ask something more of you first. Envision what it is ([[Ask_the_Oracle]] if unsure), do it (or [[Swear_an_Iron_Vow]]), and mark the bond. If you decline or fail, [[Pay_the_Price]]. 

On a **miss**, you are refused. [[Pay_the_Price]].

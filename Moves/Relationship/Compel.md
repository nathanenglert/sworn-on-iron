When **you attempt to persuade someone to do something**, envision your approach and roll. If you... 
- Charm, pacify, barter, or convince: Roll +heart (add +1 if you share a bond). 
- Threaten or incite: Roll +iron. • Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow. 

On a **strong hit**, they’ll do what you want or share what they know. Take +1 momentum. If you use this exchange to [[Gather Information]], make that move now and add +1. 

On a **weak hit**, as above, but they ask something of you in return. Envision what they want ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure). 

On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand which costs you greatly. [[Pay the Price]].

*Progress Move* 

When **you achieve what you believe to be the fulfillment of your vow**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll. 

On a **strong hit**, your quest is complete. Mark experience (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5). 

On a **weak hit**, there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. Envision what you discover ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure). Then, mark experience (troublesome=0; dangerous=1; formidable=2; extreme=3; epic=4). You may [[Swear an Iron Vow]] to set things right. If you do, add +1. 

On a **miss**, your quest is undone. Envision what happens ([[Ask the Oracle]] if unsure), and choose one. 

- You recommit: Clear all but one filled progress, and raise the questâ€™s rank by one (if not already epic). 
- You give up: [[Forsake Your Vow]]

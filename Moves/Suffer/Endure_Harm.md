When **you face physical damage**, suffer -health equal to your foeâ€™s rank or as appropriate to the situation. If your health is 0, suffer -momentum equal to any remaining -health. 

Then, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher. 

On a **strong hit**, choose one. 

- Shake it off: If your health is greater than 0, suffer -1 momentum in exchange for +1 health. 
- Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum. 

On a **weak hit**, you press on. 

On a **miss**, also suffer -1 momentum. If you are at 0 health, you must mark wounded or maimed (if currently unmarked) or roll on the following table.

Roll   | Result
-------|---------
1-10   | You suffer mortal harm. [Face_Death](Face_Death.md).
11-20  | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must [Heal](Heal.md) and raise your health above 0, or [Face_Death](Face_Death.md).
21-35  | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, [Face_Death](Face_Death.md).
36-50  | You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move).
51-100 | You are battered but still standing.

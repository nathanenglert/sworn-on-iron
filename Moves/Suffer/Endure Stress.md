When **you face mental shock or despair**, suffer -spirit equal to your foe’s rank or as appropriate to the situation. If your spirit is 0, suffer -momentum equal to any remaining -spirit. 

Then, roll +heart or +spirit, whichever is higher. 

On a **strong hit**, choose one. • Shake it off: If your spirit is greater than 0, suffer -1 momentum in exchange for +1 spirit • Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum 

On a **weak hit**, you press on. 

On a **miss**, also suffer -1 momentum. If you are at 0 spirit, you must mark shaken or corrupted (if currently unmarked) or roll on the following table.

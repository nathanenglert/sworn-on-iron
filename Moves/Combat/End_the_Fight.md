*Progress Move* 

When **you make a move to take decisive action**, and score a strong hit, you may resolve the outcome of this fight. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll. 

On a **strong hit**, this foe is no longer in the fight. They are killed, out of action, flee, or surrender as appropriate to the situation and your intent ([[Ask_the_Oracle]] if unsure). 

On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must also choose one. 

- It’s worse than you thought: [[Endure_Harm]]. 
- You are overcome: [[Endure_Stress]]. 
- Your victory is short-lived: A new danger or foe appears, or an existing danger worsens. 
- You suffer collateral damage: Something of value is lost or broken, or someone important must pay the cost. 
- You’ll pay for it: An objective falls out of reach. 
- Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance. 

On a **miss**, you have lost this fight. [[Pay_the_Price]].
